  /* Lab exercise 4 
  A. In ErnestoBlockchain class, create a getLastBlock method
     --this method simply returns the length of this.chain
  B.  Also, create an addBlock method that accepts newBlock as an inpute
      -- create a local variable named newBlock.priorBlock and set it to the  last blocks hash
      -- create another variable newBlock.hash and set it to the calculated hash of that block
      -- finally and most importantly, push the new block onto the chain
  C.   Please test the blockchain by creating an instance of the blockchain and adding three blocks (you can outbut the chain to the console)
  D.  Run this test by calling node main.js from the CLI
